# Myland---Ruby-on-Rails
User can rent an island. Built in Ruby on Rails v 5.2.1.1 with 4 models.

This is my module 2 project in my coding bootcamp with Flatiron in London. Module 1 was all Ruby and in module 2 we learnt Rails. 
Whilst starting out with a project partner, due to unfortunate circumstances she had to leave the course at the very start of our 
project so I was left to do the work on my own with this project.

The project is a Ruby on Rails application, with a Home page and register/login/logout function. As a logged in user you can 
view a list of available products/islands to rent (View/Index) with description, location, reviews and rental price.
Clicking on an island in the list will take you to a product detail page (View/Show) where you can either book the island or 
leave a review.

The review rating is validated so can only be 1-5 where 5 is the best score.
If you book the island for a particular month (chosen from a dropdown list), the page will rerender and show that month as booked.

I also processed the pictures, which are all labelled for reuse, using Affinity photo, creating equally sized pics and thumbnails 
for each island. And I wrote the copy and created the logo, which if clicked on will always take you to the home page.

Enjoy dreaming about having one of these beautiful islands all to yourself for a month!
